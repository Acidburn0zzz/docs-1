Uninstallation
==============
There are two main parts to Gantry, the framework and the template. Therefore, there are two parts to uninstalling. If you intend to uninstall only the template portion, then follow the instructions for removing the template only. Keeping the Gantry library installed really does not harm as it is only used by a Gantry-enabled template, but if you wish to uninstall the library, you can follow those steps also.


Unsetting the Gantry Template as Default
----------------------------------------
To uninstall the gantry template, you will first have to ensure that it is not set as the default template. Go to **Extensions → Template Manager**, select the checkbox to any other Site template that is not gantry, then click **Default** in the button toolbar.

Uninstall Gantry
----------------
Uninstall the Gantry component, library, plugin and template from **Extensions → Extensions Manager → Manage**. Insert **gantry** into the **Filter** and click **Search**. Select all Gantry elements you wish to uninstall, then click **Uninstall** in the button toolbar. Gantry will now be uninstalled.
